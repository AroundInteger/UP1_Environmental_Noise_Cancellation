# Due Diligence Validation Checklist: Theory-Code-Data Alignment

## Critical Validation Areas Before Claiming Success

**Principle**: Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence
**Goal**: Ensure empirical-theoretical gap is real, not methodological error

---

## 1. Code Implementation Verification

### **A. SNR Calculation Alignment**
**Theoretical Formula**:
```
SNR_improvement = (σ²_A + σ²_η) / (σ²_A + σ²_B)
```

**Critical Checks**:
- [ ] Is the code calculating exactly this ratio?
- [ ] Are variance estimates unbiased (n-1 denominator)?
- [ ] Is environmental noise σ²_η estimated correctly?
- [ ] Are we using the same variance decomposition in theory vs empirical?

### **B. Environmental Noise Estimation**
**Theoretical Assumption**: η affects both teams equally
```matlab
% Validation needed:
% 1. How is σ²_η estimated from data?
% 2. Is the estimation method theoretically sound?
% 3. Are we double-counting noise components?

function validate_environmental_estimation()
    % Check: Mixed-effects model approach
    % Check: Variance components decomposition  
    % Check: Cross-team correlation analysis
end
```

### **C. Performance Metric Alignment**
**Critical Question**: Are we comparing like-for-like?
- [ ] Theoretical SNR vs Empirical AUC improvement - are these equivalent?
- [ ] Is AUC improvement the right empirical analog for SNR improvement?
- [ ] Should we calculate empirical SNR directly from variance ratios?

## 2. Distributional Assumption Validation

### **A. Normality Assessment - Rigorous**
```matlab
% For EACH KPI, verify:
function deep_normality_check(kpi_data)
    % 1. Individual team distributions
    test_normality(X_A, 'Shapiro-Wilk', 'Anderson-Darling', 'Lilliefors');
    test_normality(X_B, 'Shapiro-Wilk', 'Anderson-Darling', 'Lilliefors');
    
    % 2. CRITICAL: Relative measure normality
    R = X_A - X_B;
    test_normality(R, 'All tests + Q-Q correlation');
    
    % 3. Environmental noise component
    estimate_eta_distribution(environmental_factors);
    
    % 4. Independence assumptions
    test_independence(X_A, X_B, 'within matches');
    test_temporal_independence('across matches');
end
```

### **B. Variance Structure Validation**
**Theoretical Model**: X_A = μ_A + ε_A + η
```matlab
% Empirical validation:
% 1. Can we actually decompose observed variance this way?
% 2. Is environmental variance consistent across teams?
% 3. Are individual variances σ²_A, σ²_B estimated correctly?

function validate_variance_decomposition(data)
    % Mixed-effects model validation
    % Variance components analysis
    % Cross-validation of estimates
end
```

---

## 3. Theoretical Framework Verification

### **A. Formula Derivation Check**
**Start from First Principles**:
```
X_A ~ N(μ_A, σ²_A + σ²_η)
X_B ~ N(μ_B, σ²_B + σ²_η)  
R = X_A - X_B ~ N(μ_A - μ_B, σ²_A + σ²_B)
```

**Critical Verification**:
- [ ] Derive SNR formulas step-by-step
- [ ] Verify all mathematical steps in supplementary material
- [ ] Cross-check against signal processing literature
- [ ] Validate independence assumptions for variance addition

### **B. Alternative Formulations**
**Question**: Are there equivalent ways to express improvement?
```matlab
% Method 1: Variance ratio approach (current)
SNR_improvement_v1 = var_absolute / var_relative;

% Method 2: Effect size approach  
effect_size_improvement = d_relative / d_absolute;

% Method 3: Classification improvement approach
classification_improvement = (AUC_rel - AUC_abs) / AUC_abs;

% Validate: Do these give consistent results?
```

## 4. Data Structure Deep Dive

### **A. Rugby Data Reality Check**
```matlab
function rugby_data_audit(data)
    % 1. Environmental factors in rugby - are they real?
    analyze_environmental_proxies(weather, venue, referee, time);
    
    % 2. Team performance correlation structure
    correlation_analysis(team_A_metrics, team_B_metrics);
    
    % 3. Match-level vs team-level effects
    hierarchical_structure_analysis();
    
    % 4. Temporal dependencies
    time_series_analysis(performance_over_seasons);
end
```

### **B. Environmental Noise Reality**
**Critical Questions**:
- Are rugby environmental effects actually "common-mode"?
- Do weather/venue/referee effects impact both teams equally?
- Is our environmental noise model realistic?

---

## 5. Implementation Bug Hunting

### **A. Systematic Code Review**
```matlab
% Critical sections to audit:
function code_audit_priority()
    % 1. Variance calculations - any off-by-one errors?
    audit_variance_calculations();
    
    % 2. Data alignment - teams matched correctly?
    audit_team_matching_logic();
    
    % 3. Missing data handling - any bias introduced?
    audit_missing_data_treatment();
    
    % 4. Cross-validation - any data leakage?
    audit_cv_procedures();
end
```

### **B. Synthetic Data Testing**
```matlab
% Generate data with KNOWN parameters
function synthetic_validation()
    % Create data with known σ²_A, σ²_B, σ²_η
    synthetic_data = generate_known_parameters();
    
    % Run analysis pipeline
    empirical_results = run_full_analysis(synthetic_data);
    
    % Compare with theoretical predictions
    theoretical_results = calculate_theory(known_parameters);
    
    % Should match exactly - if not, code bug exists
    assert(abs(empirical_results - theoretical_results) < 1e-6);
end
```

## 6. Alternative Explanations for "Favorable Gap"

### **Potential Sources of Discrepancy**:

#### **A. Methodological Issues**
- Variance estimation bias (small sample effects)
- Cross-validation optimism  
- Feature selection bias
- Data preprocessing artifacts

#### **B. Model Misspecification**
- Non-normal distributions (robust to violations?)
- Correlation structure not captured
- Time-dependent effects
- Nonlinear relationships

#### **C. Environmental Model Oversimplification**
- Environmental effects not perfectly common-mode
- Multiple environmental factors with different structures
- Environmental-individual interaction effects

## Conservative Approach

**Principle**: Better to understate results than overstate them

1. **Report empirical results accurately** but without premature theoretical claims
2. **Document all validation steps** for transparency
3. **Acknowledge limitations** explicitly
4. **Focus on robust findings** that survive scrutiny
5. **Save speculation** for future work section

This due diligence approach protects against the embarrassment of claiming breakthrough results that don't survive peer review scrutiny.
