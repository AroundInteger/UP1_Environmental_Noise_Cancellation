## **üîç Critical Insights for UP1**

### **1. Environmental Noise Cancellation Potential**
- **Strong Foundation**: Axiom 1 compliance (83.3%) indicates that rugby KPIs can effectively resist shared environmental factors
- **Relative Measures**: The high invariance scores suggest that relative measures (R = X_A - X_B) should work well for environmental noise cancellation
- **Season/Team Effects**: KPIs show strong resistance to seasonal and team-based environmental variations

### **2. Performance Prediction Challenges**
- **Ordinal Consistency Failure**: All KPIs fail to maintain consistent competitive ordering, suggesting that absolute performance values may not reliably predict outcomes
- **Relative vs. Absolute**: This failure supports the UP1 hypothesis that relative measures may outperform absolute measures

### **3. Measurement Scale Issues**
- **Scaling Problems**: All KPIs fail scaling proportionality tests, indicating that measurement units significantly affect performance
- **Standardization Need**: KPIs require proper normalization or standardization for reliable comparison

### **4. Statistical Quality Concerns**
- **Poor Signal-to-Noise**: Extremely low statistical optimality scores suggest that KPIs contain significant noise relative to signal
- **Information Content**: Low mutual information scores indicate poor predictive power
