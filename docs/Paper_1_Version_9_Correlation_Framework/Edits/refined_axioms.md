## 2.2 Axiomatic Foundation

We establish four fundamental axioms that define the necessary and sufficient conditions for effective correlation-based competitive measurement.

### Axiom 1 (Correlation-Based Variance Reduction)

For competitors A and B with correlation coefficient $\rho = \text{Cov}(X_A, X_B)/(\sigma_A \sigma_B)$, the relative measure $R = X_A - X_B$ achieves variance reduction when $\rho > 0$:

$$\text{Var}(R) = \sigma_A^2 + \sigma_B^2 - 2\rho\sigma_A\sigma_B < \sigma_A^2 + \sigma_B^2$$

**Testable Condition:** $\rho > 0$ must be empirically observable from paired competitor measurements.

### Axiom 2 (Signal Preservation)

The relative measure preserves the competitive signal while achieving variance reduction:

$$\mathbb{E}[R] = \mathbb{E}[X_A - X_B] = \mu_A - \mu_B$$

**Testable Condition:** The expected value of relative measurements must equal the true performance difference, ensuring competitive ordering is maintained.

### Axiom 3 (Scale Invariance)

For any positive scalar $\alpha > 0$, both the relative measure and correlation structure remain invariant under linear scaling:

$$R(\alpha X_A, \alpha X_B) = \alpha R(X_A, X_B)$$
$$\rho(\alpha X_A, \alpha X_B) = \rho(X_A, X_B)$$

**Testable Condition:** SNR improvement ratios must remain constant across different measurement scales when distributional properties are preserved.

### Axiom 4 (Statistical Optimality)

Under the correlation-based measurement model with regularity conditions (normality, finite variances, stable parameters), the relative measure $R = X_A - X_B$ is the minimum variance unbiased estimator (MVUE) of $\mu_A - \mu_B$ and achieves the CramÃ©r-Rao lower bound.

**Mathematical Statement:**
$$\text{Var}(R) = \sigma_A^2 + \sigma_B^2 - 2\rho\sigma_A\sigma_B = \text{CRLB}(\mu_A - \mu_B)$$

**Testable Condition:** No other unbiased estimator of the performance difference can achieve lower variance under the assumed measurement model.

### Axiom Completeness and Sufficiency

**Necessity:** Each axiom establishes a required property for effective correlation-based competitive measurement:
- Axiom 1 ensures the mechanism for improvement exists
- Axiom 2 ensures the competitive signal is preserved  
- Axiom 3 ensures universal applicability across scales
- Axiom 4 ensures theoretical optimality under model assumptions

**Sufficiency:** Together, the four axioms provide sufficient conditions for correlation-based competitive measurement to achieve predictable SNR improvements quantified by:

$$\text{SNR improvement} = \frac{1 + \kappa}{1 + \kappa - 2\sqrt{\kappa}\rho}$$

where $\kappa = \sigma_B^2/\sigma_A^2$ and $\rho$ is the observed correlation coefficient.

### Empirical Validation Framework

Each axiom provides specific testable predictions that guide empirical validation:

1. **Correlation existence** ($\rho > 0$) can be directly measured from paired observations
2. **Signal preservation** can be verified by comparing $\mathbb{E}[R]$ to known performance differences  
3. **Scale invariance** can be tested by analyzing the same data at different scales
4. **Statistical optimality** can be assessed by comparing relative measure efficiency to alternative estimators

The axiomatic foundation thus provides both theoretical rigor and practical guidance for empirical validation of the correlation-based framework in specific application domains.
