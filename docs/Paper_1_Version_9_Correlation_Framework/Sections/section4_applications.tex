\section{Applications and Cross-Domain Framework}

The correlation-based signal enhancement framework provides universal applicability across diverse competitive measurement domains. This section demonstrates practical applications and establishes implementation guidelines for practitioners seeking to apply the framework in real-world scenarios, extending beyond traditional domain-specific approaches \cite{stefani2011measurement} to provide unified competitive measurement solutions.

\subsection{Universal Decision Rules}

The framework provides clear decision rules for determining when and how to apply correlation-based signal enhancement in competitive measurement contexts.

\textbf{Correlation Threshold:}
Apply the correlation-based framework when $\rho > 0.05$, indicating measurable correlation between competitors. This threshold ensures that the framework provides meaningful improvements over absolute measurement approaches.

\textbf{Variance Ratio Analysis:}
Optimize the variance ratio $\kappa = \sigma_B^2/\sigma_A^2$ for maximum SNR improvement. The framework provides enhanced benefits when $\kappa \in [0.5, 3.0]$, representing moderate to high competitive asymmetry.

\textbf{Safety Constraints:}
Maintain safe operation by ensuring critical distance from the theoretical limit at $(\kappa=1, \rho=1)$:
\begin{equation}
\text{Critical\_distance} = \min(|\kappa - 1|, |\rho - 1|) > 0.1
\end{equation}

\textbf{Implementation Guidelines:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Measure correlation} between competitors from matched observations
    \item \textbf{Calculate variance ratio} $\kappa$ from performance data
