\begin{abstract}
Competitive measurement across domains from sports to finance requires isolating true performance differences from environmental contamination. We establish a mathematically rigorous framework for relative measurement that achieves superior signal-to-noise ratios through correlation-based signal enhancement. Our framework reveals that competitors measured under similar conditions exhibit positive correlation, enabling systematic signal enhancement through relative measurement approaches. We introduce the Signal Enhancement Factor (SEF) to quantify these improvements, extending classical enhancement factor concepts from Wiener filtering to competitive measurement contexts. The framework demonstrates complete scale independence, enabling universal application across measurement scales and domains regardless of absolute performance levels. Through comprehensive empirical validation with professional rugby performance data, we demonstrate correlation coefficients ranging from 0.086 to 0.250 with corresponding SEF values of 1.09 to 1.31 (9-31\% improvements), achieving theoretical prediction accuracy of 0.96. The framework establishes universal decision rules for competitive measurement design while providing the theoretical foundation for advanced extensions across diverse competitive domains.
