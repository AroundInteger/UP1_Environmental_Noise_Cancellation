# SEF Framework Sensitivity Analysis Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines a systematic approach to test the sensitivity and robustness of the Signal Enhancement Factor (SEF) framework using available 4-season sports performance data. The analysis aims to understand when, why, and under what conditions the SEF framework provides meaningful improvement over baseline measurement approaches.

## Framework Definition

**SEF Formula**: `SEF = (1 + κ) / (1 + κ - 2*√κ*ρ)`
- κ = variance ratio between competing entities
- ρ = environmental correlation coefficient
- Expected outcome: Enhanced signal-to-noise ratio in competitive measurement scenarios

## Core Sensitivity Dimensions

### 1. Sample Size Sensitivity Analysis

**Objective**: Determine minimum viable sample size for reliable SEF enhancement and assess performance scaling.

**Method**: Bootstrap subsampling approach
- Test sample sizes: 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% of available data
- Generate 1000+ bootstrap samples at each sample size level
- Calculate SEF improvement metrics at each sample size
- Plot SEF performance vs sample size to identify convergence patterns

**Key Questions**:
- What is the minimum sample size for statistically significant SEF improvement?
- Does SEF enhancement scale linearly or non-linearly with sample size?
- At what sample size does SEF performance plateau?

**Success Metrics**:
- Confidence interval width stabilization
- Consistent improvement over baseline measurement
- Statistical significance threshold maintenance

### 2. Temporal Stability Assessment

**Objective**: Evaluate SEF framework consistency across temporal dimensions using 4-season dataset.

**Analysis Components**:

#### 2.1 Season-by-Season Analysis
- Calculate SEF improvement for each individual season
- Compare enhancement levels across seasons
- Identify temporal variance in SEF effectiveness

#### 2.2 Rolling Window Analysis
- 2-season moving windows: Calculate SEF using overlapping season pairs
- 3-season moving windows: Test stability across 3-season periods
- Assess whether longer time windows improve or degrade SEF performance

#### 2.3 Cross-Season Validation
- Training phase: Calculate optimal κ and ρ using seasons 1-2
- Testing phase: Apply derived parameters to seasons 3-4
- Evaluate predictive power and parameter stability over time

#### 2.4 Temporal Correlation Dynamics
- Track how ρ (environmental correlation) changes across seasons
- Identify seasonal patterns, trends, or structural breaks
- Assess impact of temporal correlation changes on SEF effectiveness

**Key Questions**:
- Does SEF enhancement remain consistent across seasons?
- Are there seasonal patterns in framework effectiveness?
- How stable are optimal parameters over time?
- Do competitive environments evolve in ways that affect SEF validity?

### 3. Parameter Space Exploration

**Objective**: Map SEF behavior across the full parameter space to understand framework limits and optimal operating conditions.

#### 3.1 κ (Variance Ratio) Sensitivity
- Test range: κ ∈ [0.1, 10.0] with logarithmic spacing
- Focus areas: κ < 1 (lower variance), κ = 1 (equal variance), κ > 1 (higher variance)
- Document SEF behavior near boundary conditions

#### 3.2 ρ (Correlation) Sensitivity  
- Test range: ρ ∈ [-0.9, +0.9] with linear spacing
- Critical regions: ρ → 0 (independence), ρ → 1 (perfect correlation), ρ < 0 (negative correlation)
- Identify correlation thresholds for meaningful SEF enhancement

#### 3.3 Joint Parameter Analysis
- Generate κ-ρ heatmaps showing SEF improvement across parameter combinations
- Identify optimal parameter regions for maximum enhancement
- Map regions where SEF provides no improvement or degrades performance

#### 3.4 Boundary Condition Testing
- Test behavior at mathematical limits: ρ → 1, κ → 0, κ → ∞
- Validate theoretical predictions against empirical results
- Document mathematical stability and numerical precision requirements

## Statistical Validation Framework

### Bootstrap Robustness Testing

**Methodology**:
- Generate 1000+ bootstrap samples for each test condition
- Calculate 95% confidence intervals for all SEF improvements
- Test sensitivity to outliers and extreme performances
- Assess stability across different random sample compositions

**Robustness Checks**:
- Outlier sensitivity: Remove top/bottom 5% performers and retest
- Subset stability: Test with different team groupings and league compositions
- Temporal robustness: Test with different season orderings and combinations

### Cross-Validation Framework

#### K-Fold Validation
- Partition teams into k training/testing sets (k = 5, 10)
- Train SEF parameters on training sets, evaluate on testing sets
- Average performance across all folds to assess generalization

#### Leave-One-Team-Out (LOTO)
- Systematic removal of each team individually
- Assess SEF performance impact when specific teams are excluded
- Identify teams that disproportionately influence framework effectiveness

#### Temporal Cross-Validation
- Train on seasons 1-2, test on season 3
- Train on seasons 1-3, test on season 4
- Evaluate predictive power and parameter transferability

#### Domain Cross-Validation (if applicable)
- Test SEF parameters across different sports/leagues
- Assess framework generalizability beyond single competitive domain

### Statistical Significance Testing

#### Null Hypothesis Framework
- H₀: SEF provides no improvement over baseline measurement approaches
- H₁: SEF provides statistically significant improvement

#### Permutation Testing
- Randomize team pairings to break environmental correlation structure
- Generate null distribution through correlation destruction
- Calculate p-values for observed SEF improvements

#### Effect Size Quantification
- Calculate Cohen's d for practical significance assessment
- Distinguish between statistical significance and practical importance
- Set minimum effect size thresholds for meaningful improvement

#### Multiple Comparison Correction
- Apply Bonferroni or FDR correction for numerous sensitivity tests
- Control family-wise error rate across multiple hypotheses
- Maintain statistical rigor across comprehensive testing framework

## Potential Methodological Concerns

### Framework Assumptions

### Data Limitations
1. **Sample size constraints**: Limited number of teams and seasons may affect generalizability
2. **Domain specificity**: Results may not transfer to other competitive measurement contexts
3. **Measurement precision**: Underlying performance metrics may have inherent noise that affects SEF evaluation

### Statistical Considerations
1. **Multiple testing burden**: Comprehensive sensitivity analysis involves numerous statistical tests
2. **Effect size interpretation**: Statistical significance may not imply practical importance
3. **Parameter optimization**: Risk of overfitting to specific dataset characteristics

## Notes on Validation Strategy

This sensitivity analysis framework prioritizes methodological rigor over confirmatory results. The goal is to understand SEF framework behavior comprehensively, including identifying conditions where it fails to provide improvement. A robust analysis should reveal both the strengths and limitations of the approach, providing an honest assessment of practical utility.

The multi-dimensional sensitivity testing ensures that any claimed improvements are robust across reasonable variations in sample composition, temporal periods, and parameter selections. This approach builds confidence in framework validity while explicitly documenting conditions that limit effectiveness.
