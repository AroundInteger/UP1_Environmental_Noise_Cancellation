# SAIL Databank Registration Summary - SEF Framework Validation

## üéØ **Project Overview**

**Project Title**: Signal Enhancement Factor (SEF) Framework Validation Using Healthcare Performance Data  
**Research Type**: Healthcare Data Science / Statistical Methodology  
**Domain**: Healthcare Quality Measurement and Performance Analysis  
**Duration**: 8 months  
**Status**: Ready for SAIL Application

## üìä **Research Objective**

Validate a novel correlation-based signal enhancement framework that improves signal-to-noise ratios in competitive measurement scenarios using real healthcare performance data from SAIL Databank.

## üî¨ **Key Research Questions**

1. Can correlation-based signal enhancement improve healthcare quality measurement accuracy?
2. What are the optimal parameters for SEF framework application in healthcare?
3. How does SEF framework performance compare across different healthcare quality measures?
4. What are the practical implications for healthcare quality improvement and policy?

## üìà **Expected Healthcare Impact**

- **Quality Improvement**: Enhanced hospital performance measurement and comparison
- **Decision Support**: Improved data-driven healthcare quality decisions
- **Policy Development**: Evidence-based healthcare policy recommendations
- **Resource Optimization**: Better allocation of healthcare resources through enhanced measurement accuracy

## üìä **Data Requirements**

### **Primary Data Needs**
- Hospital performance data (quality measures, patient outcomes, efficiency metrics)
- Temporal coverage (multiple time periods for correlation analysis)
- Geographic coverage (multiple hospitals/regions for competitive comparison)
- Quality measures (patient safety indicators, mortality rates, readmission rates)

### **Sample Size Requirements**
- Minimum 100 paired measurements per metric
- At least 2 years of temporal data
- Minimum 50 hospitals for statistical power
- Multiple performance indicators per hospital

## üéØ **Research Methodology**

### **SEF Framework**
- **Signal Separation (Œ¥)**: Difference between entity performance means
- **Variance Ratio (Œ∫)**: Ratio of entity performance variances  
- **Correlation (œÅ)**: Environmental correlation between entities
- **SEF Calculation**: `SEF = (1 + Œ∫) / (1 + Œ∫ - 2*‚àöŒ∫*œÅ)`

### **Statistical Methods**
- Normality testing (Shapiro-Wilk, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, D'Agostino K¬≤)
- Correlation analysis with pairwise deletion
- SNR calculation and improvement measurement
- Statistical significance testing

## üìö **Previous Validation**
