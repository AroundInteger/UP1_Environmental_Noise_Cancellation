240001     | HAC-1       | 0.12  | 2023-Q4     | (0.08, 0.16)
360001     | HAC-1       | 0.15  | 2023-Q4     | (0.11, 0.19)
```

## SEF Framework Application

### 1. **Competitive Comparison**
- **Hospital A (Mayo)**: X_A = Performance on each metric
- **Hospital B (Cleveland)**: X_B = Performance on each metric
- **Relative Measure**: R = X_A - X_B
- **Outcome**: Which hospital performed better (win/lose)

### 2. **Expected SEF Improvements**
- **Patient Safety**: SEF = 1.30-1.50 (30-50% improvement)
- **Readmission Rates**: SEF = 1.25-1.45 (25-45% improvement)
- **Mortality Rates**: SEF = 1.35-1.55 (35-55% improvement)
- **Patient Experience**: SEF = 1.20-1.40 (20-40% improvement)

### 3. **Correlation Analysis**
- **Expected Correlation**: ρ = 0.4-0.7 (moderate positive correlation)
- **Variance Ratio**: κ = 0.8-1.2 (similar variances)
- **Signal Enhancement**: Both hospitals face similar market pressures

## Data Collection Strategy

### Phase 1: Identify Data Sources
1. **Hospital Compare Dataset**: Quality measures and outcomes
2. **HAC Dataset**: Hospital-acquired conditions
3. **HCAHPS Dataset**: Patient experience measures
4. **PSI Dataset**: Patient safety indicators

### Phase 2: Data Collection
1. **Download latest quarterly data** for both hospitals
2. **Extract performance metrics** for each hospital
3. **Create competitive comparison structure**
4. **Validate data quality** and completeness

### Phase 3: SEF Framework Application
1. **Calculate correlation** between hospital performance measures
2. **Estimate variance ratios** (κ) for each metric
3. **Apply SEF formula**: SEF = (1 + κ) / (1 + κ - 2√κρ)
4. **Validate theoretical predictions** with empirical results

## Success Criteria

### 1. **Data Quality**
- ✅ **Real data**: Actual hospital performance measurements
- ✅ **Competitive structure**: Hospitals compared on same metrics
- ✅ **Sufficient sample size**: Multiple metrics for statistical analysis
- ✅ **Temporal consistency**: Same time period for all measurements

### 2. **Framework Validation**
- ✅ **Correlation detection**: ρ > 0.3 (meaningful correlation)
- ✅ **Variance analysis**: κ within reasonable range (0.5-2.0)
- ✅ **SEF improvement**: SEF > 1.2 (at least 20% improvement)
- ✅ **Statistical significance**: p < 0.05 for improvement

### 3. **Scientific Rigor**
- ✅ **Transparent methodology**: Clear data collection procedures
- ✅ **Reproducible results**: Documented analysis pipeline
- ✅ **Honest reporting**: Acknowledge limitations and assumptions
- ✅ **Peer review ready**: Results suitable for academic publication

## Next Steps

1. **Test data download** for selected hospitals and metrics
2. **Validate data structure** and completeness
3. **Implement data collection pipeline** for hospital performance data
4. **Apply SEF framework** to collected data
5. **Document results** for paper integration

This approach ensures we collect exactly the data we need for rigorous SEF framework validation while maintaining the highest standards of scientific integrity.
