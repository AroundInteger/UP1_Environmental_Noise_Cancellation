## üî¨ **Research Methodology**

### **Theoretical Framework**
The SEF framework is based on the principle that environmental effects manifest as correlation between competitive measurements, leading to improved signal-to-noise ratios through relative measurement approaches.

**Core Components:**
1. **Signal Separation (Œ¥)**: Difference between entity performance means
2. **Variance Ratio (Œ∫)**: Ratio of entity performance variances
3. **Correlation (œÅ)**: Environmental correlation between entities
4. **SEF Calculation**: `SEF = (1 + Œ∫) / (1 + Œ∫ - 2*‚àöŒ∫*œÅ)`

### **Empirical Validation Approach**
1. **Data Collection**: Healthcare performance data from SAIL Databank
2. **Preprocessing**: Normality testing, log transformation, quality control
3. **Parameter Estimation**: Calculate Œ∫, œÅ, and Œ¥ for hospital comparisons
4. **SEF Application**: Apply framework to healthcare quality measures
5. **Validation**: Compare empirical results to theoretical predictions

### **Statistical Methods**
- **Normality Testing**: Shapiro-Wilk, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, D'Agostino K¬≤ tests
- **Correlation Analysis**: Pearson correlation with pairwise deletion
- **SNR Calculation**: Signal-to-noise ratio improvements
- **Significance Testing**: Statistical validation of SEF improvements
