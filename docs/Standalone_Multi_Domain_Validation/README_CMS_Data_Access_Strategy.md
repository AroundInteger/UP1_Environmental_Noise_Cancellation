   - Patient Safety Indicators (PSI)
   - Hospital-Acquired Conditions (HAC)
   - Readmission rates
   - Mortality rates
   - Patient experience measures (HCAHPS)

3. **Provider Information**
   - CMS Certification Number (CCN) - 6-digit provider identifier
   - Hospital types (teaching, critical access, etc.)
   - Geographic classifications
   - Service areas

4. **Financial and Utilization Data**
   - Program payments
   - Utilization rates
   - Cost data

### 3. **Readmission Rates**
- **30-Day Readmission Rate**: Overall
- **Heart Failure Readmission Rate**
- **Pneumonia Readmission Rate**
- **Acute Myocardial Infarction Readmission Rate**
- **Hip/Knee Replacement Readmission Rate**

### 4. **Mortality Rates**
- **30-Day Mortality Rate**: Overall
- **Heart Failure Mortality Rate**
- **Pneumonia Mortality Rate**
- **Acute Myocardial Infarction Mortality Rate**
- **Stroke Mortality Rate**

### 5. **Patient Experience Measures (HCAHPS)**
- **Overall Hospital Rating**
- **Communication with Nurses**
- **Communication with Doctors**
- **Responsiveness of Hospital Staff**
- **Pain Management**
- **Cleanliness and Quietness**

### 6. **Process Measures**
- **Timeliness of Care**
- **Effectiveness of Care**
- **Appropriate Use of Medical Imaging**
- **Medication Reconciliation**

## Data Access Strategy

### Phase 1: Identify Data Sources
Based on the glossary, we should look for:
1. **CMS Program Statistics** datasets
2. **Hospital Compare** data
3. **Quality Measures** datasets
4. **Provider-specific** data

### Phase 2: Data Collection
1. **Download hospital performance data** for both hospitals
2. **Extract quality measures** for each hospital
3. **Create competitive comparison structure**
4. **Validate data quality** and completeness

### Phase 3: SEF Framework Application
1. **Calculate correlation** between hospital performance measures
2. **Estimate variance ratios** (κ) for each metric
3. **Apply SEF formula**: SEF = (1 + κ) / (1 + κ - 2√κρ)
4. **Validate theoretical predictions** with empirical results

## Expected SEF Framework Benefits

### 1. **Competitive Comparison**
- **Hospital A (Mayo)**: X_A = Performance on each metric
- **Hospital B (Cleveland)**: X_B = Performance on each metric
- **Relative Measure**: R = X_A - X_B
- **Outcome**: Which hospital performed better (win/lose)

### 2. **Expected SEF Improvements**
- **Patient Safety**: SEF = 1.30-1.50 (30-50% improvement)
- **Readmission Rates**: SEF = 1.25-1.45 (25-45% improvement)
- **Mortality Rates**: SEF = 1.35-1.55 (35-55% improvement)
- **Patient Experience**: SEF = 1.20-1.40 (20-40% improvement)

### 3. **Correlation Analysis**
- **Expected Correlation**: ρ = 0.4-0.7 (moderate positive correlation)
- **Variance Ratio**: κ = 0.8-1.2 (similar variances)
- **Signal Enhancement**: Both hospitals face similar market pressures

## Next Steps

1. **Test data access** for CMS Program Statistics datasets
2. **Download hospital data** for Mayo Clinic and Cleveland Clinic
3. **Extract quality measures** for both hospitals
4. **Apply SEF framework** to the data
5. **Document results** for paper integration

This approach leverages the comprehensive CMS data available through the Program Statistics system and provides a robust foundation for SEF framework validation.
