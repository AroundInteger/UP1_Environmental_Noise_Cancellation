# üî¨ Interactive Data Analysis Pipeline

## üìã **Overview**

The Interactive Data Analysis Pipeline is a user-friendly tool that analyzes your data to determine optimal measurement strategies. It automatically detects environmental noise, determines whether relative or absolute measures work better, and provides clear recommendations with confidence levels.

## üéØ **What It Does**

### **1. Environmental Noise Detection**
- **Automatically detects** if environmental noise (Œ∑) exists in your data
- **Quantifies noise level** (Very Low, Low, Moderate, High, Very High)
- **Determines** if teams/groups are affected by shared environmental factors

### **2. Optimal Measurement Strategy**
- **Analyzes each metric** to determine if relative or absolute measures work better
- **Calculates variance ratios** (r = œÉ_B/œÉ_A) for each metric
- **Predicts SNR improvements** using our theoretical framework
- **Provides clear recommendations** with confidence levels

### **3. Decision Framework**
- **Primary strategy recommendation** based on your data
- **Expected improvement percentages** for each metric
- **Confidence levels** for all recommendations
- **Detailed analysis** of why each recommendation was made

## üöÄ **How to Use**

### **Step 1: Prepare Your Data**
Your CSV file should contain:
- **Team/Group column**: Identifies different teams, groups, or competitors
- **Outcome column**: Binary outcomes (Win/Loss, Success/Failure, etc.)
- **Metric columns**: Numeric performance measures you want to analyze

### **Step 2: Run the Analysis**
```matlab
% Option 1: Use the simplified interface
run('scripts/Run_User_Analysis.m')

% Option 2: Use the full interactive pipeline
run('scripts/Interactive_Data_Analysis_Pipeline.m')
```

### **Step 3: Follow the Prompts**
- **Select your data file** from the available options
- **Choose columns** (or let the system auto-detect)
- **Review the analysis** as it runs
- **Get comprehensive results** and recommendations

### **Step 4: Review Results**
The pipeline generates:
- **Comprehensive analysis report** (MAT file)
- **Human-readable text report** (TXT file)
- **Visualization plots** (PNG files)
- **Summary statistics** and recommendations

## üîç **Understanding the Results**

### **Environmental Noise Levels**
- **Very Low (Œ∑ < 0.1)**: No shared environmental effects
- **Low (Œ∑ < 0.3)**: Minimal environmental effects
- **Moderate (Œ∑ < 0.5)**: Some environmental effects
- **High (Œ∑ < 0.7)**: Significant environmental effects
- **Very High (Œ∑ ‚â• 0.7)**: Strong environmental effects

### **SNR Improvement Interpretation**
- **> 2x**: Excellent improvement with relative measures
- **1.5x - 2x**: Good improvement with relative measures
- **1x - 1.5x**: Moderate improvement with relative measures
- **< 1x**: Absolute measures are better

### **Confidence Levels**
- **> 80%**: High confidence in recommendation
- **60% - 80%**: Moderate confidence in recommendation
- **< 60%**: Low confidence, consider additional data

## üìà **Visualizations**

The pipeline generates comprehensive visualizations including:

1. **SNR Improvement by Metric**: Bar chart showing expected improvements
2. **Variance Ratios**: Shows which metrics favor relative vs absolute measures
3. **Environmental Noise Analysis**: Pie chart of noise vs independent variation
4. **Strategy Recommendations**: Count of relative vs absolute recommendations
5. **Confidence Levels**: Confidence scores for each metric
6. **Analysis Summary**: Key findings and recommendations

## üéØ **Decision Framework**

### **When to Use Relative Measures**
- **Variance ratio r < ‚àö3 ‚âà 1.732**
- **Environmental noise is low or moderate**
- **Teams have different variance characteristics**
- **Expected SNR improvement > 1x**

### **When to Use Absolute Measures**
- **Variance ratio r > ‚àö3 ‚âà 1.732**
- **Environmental noise is very high**
- **Teams have similar variance characteristics**
- **Expected SNR improvement < 1x**

### **Break-Even Point**
- **r = ‚àö3 ‚âà 1.732**: Relative and absolute measures are equally good
- **Below this**: Relative measures are better
- **Above this**: Absolute measures are better

## üî¨ **Technical Details**

### **Mathematical Framework**
- **SNR Improvement Formula**: SNR_R/SNR_A = 4/(1+r¬≤)
- **Variance Ratio**: r = œÉ_B/œÉ_A
- **Break-Even Point**: r = ‚àö3
- **Maximum Improvement**: 4x (when r = 0)

### **Environmental Noise Detection**
- **Team Correlation Analysis**: Measures correlation between team performances
- **Threshold-Based Detection**: Œ∑ > 0.3 indicates environmental effects
- **Noise Level Classification**: Based on correlation strength

### **Confidence Calculation**
- **Data Quality**: Based on sample size and data completeness
- **Statistical Significance**: Based on variance estimates
- **Model Fit**: Based on theoretical framework validation
