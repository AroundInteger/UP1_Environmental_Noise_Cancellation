## 🧮 **Mathematical Derivation**

### **Given Function:**
```
f(r) = SNR_R/SNR_A = 4 / (1 + r²)
where r = σ_B/σ_A (variance ratio)
```

### **First Derivative:**
```
f'(r) = d/dr [4 / (1 + r²)]
f'(r) = 4 × d/dr [(1 + r²)^(-1)]
f'(r) = 4 × (-1) × (1 + r²)^(-2) × d/dr [1 + r²]
f'(r) = 4 × (-1) × (1 + r²)^(-2) × 2r
f'(r) = -8r / (1 + r²)²
```

### **Critical Points:**
```
f'(r) = 0
-8r / (1 + r²)² = 0
-8r = 0
r = 0
```

### **Second Derivative:**
```
f''(r) = d/dr [-8r / (1 + r²)²]
f''(r) = -8 × d/dr [r / (1 + r²)²]
f''(r) = -8 × [(1 + r²)² - r × 2(1 + r²) × 2r] / (1 + r²)⁴
f''(r) = -8 × [(1 + r²) - 4r²] / (1 + r²)³
f''(r) = -8 × [1 - 3r²] / (1 + r²)³
```

### **Second Derivative Test:**
```
At r = 0:
f''(0) = -8 × [1 - 3(0)²] / (1 + 0²)³
f''(0) = -8 × [1 - 0] / (1 + 0)³
f''(0) = -8 × 1 / 1³
f''(0) = -8 < 0
```

**Since f''(0) < 0, r = 0 is a LOCAL MAXIMUM**

### **Maximum Value:**
```
f(0) = 4 / (1 + 0²) = 4 / 1 = 4
```

**Therefore, maximum SNR_R/SNR_A = 4x when r = 0**

## 📊 **Function Behavior Analysis**

### **Key Points:**

| r = σ_B/σ_A | f(r) = SNR_R/SNR_A | f'(r) | f''(r) | Behavior |
|-------------|-------------------|-------|--------|----------|
| **0.0** | **4.000** | **0.000** | **-8.000** | **MAXIMUM** |
| 0.5 | 3.200 | -2.560 | -1.024 | Decreasing |
| 1.0 | 2.000 | -2.000 | 2.000 | Decreasing |
| 1.5 | 1.231 | -1.136 | 1.340 | Decreasing |
| 2.0 | 0.800 | -0.640 | 0.704 | Decreasing |
| 3.0 | 0.400 | -0.240 | 0.208 | Decreasing |

### **Key Insights:**
- **Maximum at r = 0**: SNR_R/SNR_A = 4x
- **Monotonic decrease**: Function decreases as r increases
- **No other critical points**: r = 0 is the only maximum
- **Asymptotic behavior**: Approaches 0 as r → ∞

---

## 🎯 **Physical Interpretation**

### **When r = 0 (σ_B = 0):**
- **Team B has zero variance** (perfect consistency)
- **Team A has some variance**
- **This is the ideal case** for relative measures
- **SNR_R/SNR_A = 4x** (maximum improvement)

### **When r << 1 (σ_B << σ_A):**
- **Team B has much lower variance** than Team A
- **Team B is more consistent** than Team A
- **SNR_R/SNR_A approaches 4x**
- **This is the practical "maximum" case**

### **When r = 1 (σ_B = σ_A):**
- **Both teams have equal variance**
- **Balanced case**
- **SNR_R/SNR_A = 2x**

### **When r >> 1 (σ_B >> σ_A):**
- **Team B has much higher variance** than Team A
- **Team B is less consistent** than Team A
- **SNR_R/SNR_A approaches 0**
- **Relative measures become worse** than absolute measures

## 🎯 **Answer to Your Question**

### **"Is SNR_R maximized when σ_B << σ_A?"**

**YES, absolutely!**

### **Mathematical Proof:**
1. **Function**: f(r) = 4 / (1 + r²)
2. **First derivative**: f'(r) = -8r / (1 + r²)²
3. **Critical point**: f'(r) = 0 → r = 0
4. **Second derivative**: f''(r) = -8(1 - 3r²) / (1 + r²)³
5. **Second derivative test**: f''(0) = -8 < 0 → **MAXIMUM**
6. **Maximum value**: f(0) = 4

### **Physical Interpretation:**
- **r = 0** means **σ_B = 0** (Team B has zero variance)
- **r << 1** means **σ_B << σ_A** (Team B has much lower variance)
- **Both cases** approach the **theoretical maximum of 4x improvement**

---

## 🔍 **Practical Implications**

### **1. Optimal Conditions:**
- **Maximum SNR improvement** occurs when **σ_B = 0**
- **Practical maximum** occurs when **σ_B << σ_A**
- **Both cases** give **SNR_R/SNR_A ≈ 4x**

### **2. Real-World Applications:**
- **Look for scenarios** where one team/group has much lower variance
- **Relative measures** provide maximum benefit in these cases
- **Equal variance cases** (r = 1) still provide good 2x improvement

### **3. Rugby Data Reality:**
- **r ≈ 1** (close to equal variances)
- **~2x improvement** observed (good but not maximum)
- **Theoretical framework** correctly predicts outcomes

## 🏆 **Final Answer**

### **To your question: "Is SNR_R maximized when σ_B << σ_A?"**

**YES, SNR_R is MAXIMIZED when σ_B << σ_A.**

### **Mathematical proof:**
```
f(r) = 4 / (1 + r²)
f'(r) = -8r / (1 + r²)²
f'(r) = 0 → r = 0
f''(0) = -8 < 0 → MAXIMUM
f(0) = 4 → SNR_R/SNR_A = 4x
```

### **Physical meaning:**

- **r << 1**: σ_B << σ_A (Team B has much lower variance)
- **Both cases**: Approach theoretical maximum of 4x improvement

### **Empirical validation:**
- **Rugby data**: r ≈ 1 → 2x improvement (good but not maximum)
- **Theoretical predictions**: Match empirical observations
- **Framework**: Correctly identifies optimization conditions

**The mathematical framework using calculus definitively proves that SNR_R is maximized when σ_B << σ_A, specifically when σ_B = 0, giving a theoretical maximum of 4x improvement.**
