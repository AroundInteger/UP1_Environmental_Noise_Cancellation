BOOTSTRAP NECESSITY ANALYSIS REPORT
========================================

DATASET OVERVIEW
--------------------
Total studies: 9
Class A (Interventional): 7 studies
Class B (Observational): 2 studies
Sample size ratio: 7:2 = 3.5:1

BOOTSTRAP RECOMMENDATION
------------------------------
RECOMMENDED: Implement bootstrap
Reasons:
  - Sample size imbalance > 3:1
  - Extreme variance asymmetry
  - Insufficient observations in minority class

THEORETICAL IMPLICATIONS
-------------------------
The decision to bootstrap affects how the competitive
measurement framework axioms are tested and validated.
